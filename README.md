<h1> ChatGPT-Clon </h1>

I used Html5 and Css during the design phase. 

With Javascript, I enabled the application to actively answer questions. 

As API, I used the special API offered by ChatGPT. 

You can find dark and light mode options as design.

 There is also an option to clear your past chats.
